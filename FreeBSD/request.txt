Synopsis: New port: multimedia/openstopmotion Webcam capture program for creating stopmotion video
Category: ports
Class: change-request
Release: 9.1-STABLE
Environment: FreeBSD server.pfp.de 9.1-STABLE FreeBSD 9.1-STABLE #0 r248870: Sun Mar 31 08:45:15 CEST 2013     root@server.pfp.de:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  amd64
Full Description: 

I'm author of the stop motion capture tool OpenStopMotion, which I developed on FreeBSD and Linux. I would like to add it to the FreeBSD ports collection.

OpenStopMotion is a capture program for creating stopmotion video clips. It
runs on Linux and FreeBSD and it can capture from all webcams supported by
the system. It's license is GPLv3.

This is my first port, so I hope I have done everything right. At least it builds and portlint -A does not show me any errors :-)

Thanks and best regards,
Patrick Fedick
