OpenStopMotion Installation Instructions
========================================

In this file you find instructions on how to compile OpenStopMotion from
source.

Contents:
  1. General
  2. FreeBSD
  3. Ubuntu / Debian
  4. RedHat / CentOS
  5. Automated compilation


1. General
==========

You need to download the source distribution from Sourceforge, which you
can find here:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/openstopmotion/files/
    
The source distribution fille is called OpenStopMotion-0.6.1-src.tar.bz2



2. FreeBSD
==========

OpenStopMotion runs smooth on FreeBSD 9. FreeBSD is also the main development
platform for OpenStopMotion. It requires the webcamd daemon, which provides
USB device drivers for hundreds of different USB based webcam and DVB USB
devices. It is actualy a port of "Video4Linux" into userspace on FreeBSD.

Install the following ports from the ports-collection:

   multimedia/webcamd
   lang/nasm
   devel/pcre
   graphics/png
   graphics/jpeg
   graphics/tiff
   print/freetype
   converters/libiconv
   devel/qt4
   
Edit /etc/rc.conf to enable the webcamd daemon and start it:

   echo "webcamd_enable=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/webcamd start   


Untar the source distribution:

   tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.1-src.tar.bz2

Build the ppl7-library:

   cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.1
   mkdir -p bin include lib
   WORK=`pwd`
   cd ppl7
   ./configure --with-pcre=/usr/local --with-libiconv-prefix=/usr/local \
               --with-nasm --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr/local \
               --prefix=$WORK
   make install
   cd ..
   
Build OpenStopMotion

   PATH="$WORK/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH
   cd osm
   qmake-qt4
   make
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in the release subdirectory,
which is all you need. You could copy it to /usr/local/bin:

  cp release/OpenStopMotion /usr/local/bin
  


3. Ubuntu / Debian
==================

Ubuntu is my secondary development platform for OpenStopMotion, so it should
work without problems. It is developed and testet on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but
it should work on older or newer versions, too.

Install the following packages:

   sudu apt-get install libpcre3-dev libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev \
        libfreetype6-dev libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools \
        qt4-qmake libqt4-opengl-dev nasm
        
Untar the source distribution:

   tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.1-src.tar.bz2

Build the ppl7-library:

   cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.1
   mkdir -p bin include lib
   WORK=`pwd`
   cd ppl7
   ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr \
               --with-nasm --prefix=$WORK
   make install
   cd ..
   
Build OpenStopMotion

   PATH="$WORK/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH
   cd osm
   qmake-qt4
   make
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in the release subdirectory,
which is all you need. You could copy it to /usr/bin:

  cp release/OpenStopMotion /usr/bin 
   
   
4. RedHat / CentOS
==================

Install the following packages:

TODO!!!

Untar the source distribution:

   tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.1-src.tar.bz2

Build the ppl7-library:

   cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.1
   mkdir -p bin include lib
   WORK=`pwd`
   cd ppl7
   ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr \
               --with-nasm --prefix=$WORK
   make install
   cd ..
   
Build OpenStopMotion

   PATH="$WORK/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH
   cd osm
   qmake-qt4
   make
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in the release subdirectory,
which is all you need. You could copy it to /usr/bin:

  cp release/OpenStopMotion /usr/bin 


5. Automated compilation
========================

For generating binary packages for different platforms in an automated way,
I have written a script, which does all the work. The script is released
in the source distribution. In theory, you unpack the sources and start
the build script. It will detect your platform, and if all goes well, you
will find a binary package in the subfolder "distfiles".

At this time, the script supports Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS and
FreeBSD.

The script is in the root directory of the source distribution and is
called build_package.sh
