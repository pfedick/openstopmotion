OpenStopMotion Installation Instructions
========================================

In this file you find instructions on how to compile OpenStopMotion from
source.

Contents:
  1. General
  2. FreeBSD
  3. Ubuntu / Debian
  4. RedHat / CentOS


1. General
==========

You need to download the source distribution from Sourceforge, which you
can find here:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/openstopmotion/files/
    
The source distribution fille is called OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2



2. FreeBSD
==========

OpenStopMotion runs smooth on FreeBSD 9. FreeBSD is also the main development
platform for OpenStopMotion. It requires the webcamd daemon, which provides
USB device drivers for hundreds of different USB based webcam and DVB USB
devices. It is actualy a port of "Video4Linux" into userspace on FreeBSD.


2.1 Installation from ports
===========================

You can find OpenStopMotion in the ports collection:

cd /usr/ports/multimedia/openstopmotion
make install


2.2 Manual installation
=======================

Install the following ports from the ports collection:

   multimedia/webcamd
   lang/nasm
   devel/pcre
   graphics/png
   graphics/jpeg
   graphics/tiff
   print/freetype
   converters/libiconv	(FreeBSD 9.x only!)
   devel/qt4
   
Untar the source distribution:

   tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2

Configure and build the sources:

   cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.5
   ./configure --with-nasm
   make install
   cd ..
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in /usr/local/bin.
You should also find an icon in your start menue below multimedia.


2.3 Enable webcamd
==================

If you never used a webcam on FreeBSD before, you need to enable the webcam
daemon, which was installed in the above procedure:

   echo "webcamd_enable=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/webcamd start   
   

3. Ubuntu / Debian
==================

Ubuntu is my secondary development platform for OpenStopMotion, so it should
work without problems. It is developed and testet on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but
it should work on older or newer versions, too.

Install the following packages:

   sudu apt-get install libpcre3-dev libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev \
        libfreetype6-dev libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools \
        qt4-qmake libqt4-opengl-dev nasm
        
Untar the source distribution:

   tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2

Configure and build the sources:

   cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.5
   ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr \
               --with-nasm --prefix=/usr
   make install

   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in /usr/bin. 
You should also find an icon in your start menue below multimedia.
   
   
4. RedHat / CentOS
==================

Install the following packages:

TODO!!!

Untar the source distribution:

   tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2

Configure and build the sources:

   cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.5
   ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr \
               --with-nasm --prefix=/usr
   make install
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in /usr/bin. 
You should also find an icon in your start menue below multimedia.
