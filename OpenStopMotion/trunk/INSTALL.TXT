OpenStopMotion Installation Instructions
========================================

In this file you find instructions on how to compile OpenStopMotion from
source.

Contents:
=========
  1. General
  2. FreeBSD
  3. Ubuntu / Debian
  4. RedHat / CentOS


1. General
==========

You need to download the source distribution from Sourceforge, which you
can find here:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/openstopmotion/files/
    
The source distribution fille is called OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2



2. FreeBSD
==========

OpenStopMotion runs on FreeBSD 9 or 10. FreeBSD is also the main development
platform for OpenStopMotion. It requires the webcamd daemon, which provides
USB device drivers for hundreds of different USB based webcam and DVB USB
devices. It is actualy a port of "Video4Linux" into userspace on FreeBSD.
If you never used a webcam on FreeBSD, please also read chapter 2.4!


2.1 Installation from ports
===========================

I'm working on getting OpenStopMortion into the FreeBSD Ports-Collection.
When it's done, you can simply install it the same way as every other port:

    cd /usr/ports/multimedia/openstopmotion
    make install

or

    portmaster multimedia/openstopmotion
  

2.2 Install from .shar-File
===========================
You can also download the "*-FreeBSD-Port.shar"-File from Sourceforge. It
actually contains the FreeBSD-Port. Unpack the file by calling it with "sh",
and build it like a normal port:

    sh OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-FreeBSD-Port.shar
    cd openstopmotion
    make
    make install


2.3 Manual installation
=======================

Install the following ports from the ports collection:

    multimedia/webcamd
    lang/nasm
    devel/pcre
    graphics/png
    graphics/jpeg
    graphics/tiff
    print/freetype
    converters/libiconv	(FreeBSD 9.x only!)
    devel/qt4 or devel/qt5 
   
Untar the source distribution:

    tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2

Configure and build the sources:

    cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.5
    ./configure --with-nasm
    make
    make install
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in /usr/local/bin.
You should also find an icon in the multimedia section of your start menue.


2.4 Enable webcamd
==================

If you never used a webcam on FreeBSD before, you need to enable the webcam
daemon, which was installed in the above procedure. Type as root:

    echo "webcamd_enable=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/webcamd start   




3. Ubuntu / Debian
==================

Ubuntu is my secondary development platform for OpenStopMotion, so it should
work without problems. It is developed and testet on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but
it should work on older or newer versions, too.

Install the following packages:

    sudu apt-get install libpcre3-dev libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev \
         libfreetype6-dev libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools \
         qt4-qmake libqt4-opengl-dev nasm
        
Untar the source distribution:

    tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2

Configure and build the sources:

    cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.5
    ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr \
                --with-nasm --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in /usr/bin. 
You should also find an icon in the multimedia section of your start menue.
   
   
4. RedHat / CentOS
==================

Install the following packages:

TODO!!!

Untar the source distribution:

    tar -xjf OpenStopMotion-0.6.5-src.tar.bz2

Configure and build the sources:

    cd OpenStopMotion-0.6.5
    ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-jpeg --with-png --with-libtiff=/usr \
                --with-nasm --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install
   
After that, you can find the compiled binary in /usr/bin. 
You should also find an icon in the multimedia section of your start menue.
